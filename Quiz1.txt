1. In the Insertion Sort algorithm, how is the sorting accomplished?

a. By building a sorted portion of the array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position within the sorted portion.
b. By partitioning the array into two subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging them.

d. By selecting the maximum element and moving it to the end of the array.

Answer: a

2. In the Selection Sort algorithm, how are elements sorted?

a. By repeatedly dividing the array into smaller subarrays and sorting them recursively.
b. By comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
c. By repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
d. By selecting the maximum element and moving it to the end of the array.
